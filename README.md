# simulations_experimental_uncertainties

Pyhton simulations to help undestand the process of reducing the uncertainty by averaging or fitting lines to experimental data.

Data are randomly drawn from gaussian distributions.

The code is meant to be launched from a terminal in front of students. It refreshes the graph in live and pauses to give explanations.
Graphs should be resized during the process to help reading the titles that might overlap otherwise (can be done during pauses or during
the run).

The code is commented in french.
